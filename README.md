This repository conyains MATLAB codes for decision stump, bagging and boosting with the SPECT dataset.

1. decision_tree_main.m: Implements the decision stump learning algorithm, which learns a decision tree with a single test.
2. bagging_boosting_main.m: Bagging and AdaBoost using the decision stump algorithm as the base learner.

These codes were implemented in Fall 2014 as a part of Machine Learning Coursework.
